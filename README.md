# MLA-Heart-Disease-Classification
This project applies machine learning algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression—to classify heart disease risk. Using a dataset with patient health metrics, the model predicts the likelihood of heart disease, demonstrating the power of multiple algorithms for medical classification tasks.
